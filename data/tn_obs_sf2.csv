The insect was very fast and extremely hard to catch. When I observed the organism the temperature was over 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It has two black eyes and long antennae (about as long as the length of the insect's body). It is about 1 cm long. The insect has six legs that are hairy on the upper part of the leg. It has jointed back legs. The insect is yellow/white/clear in color. The abdomen of the insect has unusual striations and is a darker color than the rest of the body. There are two tiny attachments off the back of the insect's abdomen. There are no clear distinctions between the head, thorax, and abdomen.

It has black eyes that are slightly clouded. The antennae of the grasshopper are not located on the tope of its head, they are located under the eyes of the grasshopper. There is an attachment above each of the eyes of the grasshopper (it resembles an attachments on mandibles that aid in eating). The underside of the thorax/abdomen of the grasshopper is segmented and white/tan in color. The underside of the head and legs of the grasshopper are yellow/tan in color. It has horizontal and thick black stripes on its back legs that stop after the joint. The grasshopper has a black head (top view).

1740300,2015-07-09,"When the grasshopper was observed the weather was very overcast and rainy (the temperature was about 65 degrees Fahrenheit). It was found approximately 4/5 meters from a pond. The grasshopper was caught in the reeds/grass that was flattened and wet. Approximately 10 grasshoppers in the same area. The grasshopper was about 2 cm in length. The antennae were smaller than the 4 front legs. It has 4 attachments on the mandible (that probably aid in eating). The grasshopper has black designs on its back (head, thorax, and abdomen) and on its back legs. The patterns on its back legs are horizontal black stripes. The underside of the organism is tan and segmented. The wings do not run the full length of the body, they start at the back of the head and stop between the first and second legs. I believe there is a forewing that covers the actual wings of the grasshopper. The forewing is black with a small dot. When I observed the grasshopper hoping, it did not utilize its wings and mostly used its back legs to jump. It has burgundy/brown eyes and has hairy legs. It also made a loud ""clicking"" noise when it jumped. The front four legs were thin and short compared to the thick, bent, and powerful hind legs of the organism (the organism used these legs to hop with).  The markings on the organism are very symmetrical. I believe that this grasshopper is an example of a fifth instar stage and is not an full grown adult migratory grasshopper because the wings of the grasshopper do not run the full length of the body.

1735768,2015-07-07,"I am not sure if this is a grasshopper or what species of grasshopper it is. Found in grassland. When the organism was captured it was very active and jumpy. It also made a loud ""clicking"" noise when it jumped. It was tannish with black markings along its back and hind legs. On its hind legs, the black markings were horizontal stripes that ran down the length of the leg. The organism was about 2 cm long. It has six legs, two antennae, and 4 attachments on the mandible (possibly to aid with eating). The front four legs were thin and short compared to the thick, bent, and powerful hind legs of the organism (the organism used these legs to hop with). The antennae are shorter than the four front legs. The markings on the organism are very symmetrical and the body is segmented. I believe that this grasshopper is an example of a fifth instar stage and is not an full grown adult migratory grasshopper because the wings of the grasshopper do not run the full length of the body.

1734634,2015-07-02,"When I observed this butterfly, it was foggy/ overcast (the temperature was not over 75 degrees Fahrenheit). It was found in a grassland clearing on the edge of a Douglass fir forest. The butterfly landed on a stalk near the base of a grass stem (not sure what species of grass). The wingspan of the butterfly (horizontally from right tip to left tip) was approximately 5 inches. The body of the butterfly was thin, furry/hairy, and about 1- 1 1/2 inches in length. The butterfly was ""lazy"" and did not flutter away when the camera was placed very close (the camera was approximately an inch away from the organism) which may be due to the lack of sun during this observation. I believe this is a buckeye butterfly, but I am not sure if the buckeye is a common buckeye butterfly or a subspecies (Junonia coenia coenia). I also saw 1-2 other buckeye butterflies in the same area. The buckeye did not fully spread its wings, so the spots/ ""eyes"" on the top of the second wing were not entirely visible. The body of the butterfly is a medium/dark grey/brown. This coloring of the body continues onto the wings, but in a lighter hue. There are two orange stripes on the top of the top wing.

1734620,2015-07-02,"I used a wildflower field guide to identify this chicory flower. I believe it is Cichorium intybus, but the stamens of the flower are curled instead of straight (as seen in the field guide pictures). I am not sure if the plant I found is a separate species of flower or if it is a subspecies of Cichorium intybus. I found the flower in a grassland that was on the edge of a forest. There was only one plant within the small area. The plant had approximately 6-8 flowers and had many stems that branched off from the base of the plant. The leaves of the plant were only found at the base of the plant and towards the bottom of the stems (in other words the leaves were not found near the flowers, which were located at the top of the plant). There were grasses (not sure what species) and yellow flowers (not sure what species) around the Cichorium intybus plant. The plant was approximately 2 feet tall from the base of the plant (where the plant met the ground) to the flowers at the top of the plant. The flowers were a periwinkle blue in color, about 18- 27 inches in circumference and about 6-9 inches in diameter. Inside some of the flowers, at the base of the filaments, there were black ants (not sure what species) and a buckeye butterfly was found in the same area (less than a foot away from the plant).  On the day I took this observation, it was foggy/overcast and the temperature was not more than 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
